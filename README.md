# PeggleTutorial
The source and resources for my Peggle in PyGame tutorial series.
## Usage
Grab the source from whichever tutorial you would like to run/edit. And place all the files in the same directory as the resources folder. Then you should just be able to run the **peggle_clone.py** file.
## Disclaimer
I don't own any of the audio resources used they belong to PopCap Games. I have however, rendered/edited all of the images in the resources folder and you're free to use them in whatever you please.
